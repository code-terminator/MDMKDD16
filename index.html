								</header>
								<p><b>In conjunction with <a href="http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/" target="blank">22<sup>nd</sup> ACM SIGKDD Conference (KDD 2016)</a><br />
								      Augest 13 - 17, 2016, San Francisco, California, USA</b></p>
								<p>
                  The workshop will bring together experts in the analysis of digital media content,
                  multimedia databases, knowledge engineers and domain experts from different applied
                  disciplines with potential in multimedia data mining.
                  A new theme of this edition of the workshop is to present and discuss how multimedia is
                  integrated into people’s daily life. With the large growth of devices and data,
                  we want to focus this workshop on mining large scale rich content in a networked society.
                </p>

                Shiyu Chang is a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of
                Prof. Thomas S. Huang. He has wide range of research interests in data exploratory and analytics at large-scale.
                Specifically, his current research directions lie on building high performance and reliable systems with the
                help of the large-scale multi-modality information to solve complex computational tasks in real world.
                He received his B.S. at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2011 with the highest
                University Honor (Bronze Tablet Award). He graduated from the Department of Electrical and Computer
                Engineering (ECE) and obtained his M.S. degree in 2014. He is a recipient of the 2014-2015 ECE fellowship
                sponsored by Kodak. Most of Shiyu's research has been published in top data mining and computer
                vision venues. The paper Factorized Similarity Learning in Networks has been selected as the best
                student paper in ICDM 2014.
